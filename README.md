# DES
First uploading. This is a Cpp project that implements the DES 
encryption  algorithm  in C++. At  this moment we are  able to
encript just .txt files. SOME COMMENTS ON THE CODE ARE NEEDED.
ERROR HANDLING IS LIMITED. IMPROVEMENT ON THE MEMORY MANAGEMENT
IS NEEDED.

NOTE: Sorry for the bad grammar; I'm not a native english speaker.
